# MyFirstProject
This is my first HTML Project.
The project is about myself, work experience, qualifications and social media accounts.
My website consists of four different web pages, which I named, index.html (home page), educational.html, work_experience.html and summary.html.  
Index.html, introduces me and all other pages can be accessed from the index. 
education.html includes table, bootstrap to access other pages 
work_experience is about my work experience using ordered and unordered list. 
Summary is about my social media accounts.
